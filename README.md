📄 Text-to-Audio Convertor Web App using AWS (PDF to MP3 + Email Delivery)
This project is a real-world, serverless web application built on AWS that allows users to:

Upload a PDF or DOCX file
Select a Polly voice
Convert the document's text into MP3 audio
Automatically email the generated audio file to the user

🧰 Tech Stack
Layer	Technology
Frontend	HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend	AWS Lambda (Python)
Storage	Amazon S3
TTS Engine	Amazon Polly
Email	Amazon SES
API	Amazon API Gateway
🧐 How It Works
User uploads a document via the web interface and selects a voice + email.

Frontend calls an API Gateway endpoint, which invokes a Lambda function to generate a presigned S3 upload URL.

The document is uploaded to S3 using the presigned URL.

S3 triggers another Lambda function (convertTextToAudio) when a file is uploaded to uploads/.

This function:

Extracts text from the file (using PyPDF2 for PDF or docx2txt for DOCX)
Sends the text to Amazon Polly to generate audio
Uploads the MP3 to audio/ in S3
Generates a presigned download link for the audio
Sends an email via Amazon SES with the link
💪 Features
✅ PDF and DOCX file support
✅ Upload via secure, presigned S3 URLs
✅ Choose from multiple Amazon Polly voices
✅ Email delivery with clickable download/play link
✅ No servers to manage (fully serverless)

🔐 Security
✅ S3 Bucket is private with Block All Public Access enabled
✅ All access is granted via temporary presigned URLs
✅ IAM policies restrict each Lambda to only necessary actions

🧲 Environment Variables
These should be set in the Lambda configuration:

Variable	Description
BUCKET_NAME	Name of your S3 bucket
SENDER_EMAIL	Verified SES email to send messages from
📨 Sample Email Output
Subject: Your Audio is Ready!
